        "1.  Gradient Descent:\n",
        "    *   Explanation: The most basic optimizer. It calculates the gradient (slope) of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters and updates the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss.\n",
        "    *   Example: Imagine you're in a valley (the loss function) and want to reach the lowest point. Gradient descent is like taking small steps downhill in the direction of the steepest slope.\n",
        "2.  Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):\n",
        "    *   Explanation: A variant of gradient descent that uses a single data point (or a small batch) to estimate the gradient in each iteration. This makes it faster than standard gradient descent, especially for large datasets.\n",
        "    *   Example: Instead of calculating the average slope for the entire valley, SGD estimates the slope based on where you are standing. It's noisier but faster.\n",
        "3.  Momentum:\n",
        "    *   Explanation: Improves SGD by adding momentum. It helps the optimizer to accelerate in the relevant direction and dampen oscillations. It's like a ball rolling down a hill â€“ it gains momentum and smooths out the path.\n",
        "    *   Example: The ball rolling down the hill, picking up speed and overcoming small bumps along the way.\n",
        "4.  Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation):\n",
        "    *   Explanation: Combines the concepts of momentum and adaptive learning rates. It uses estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients to adapt the learning rates for each parameter.\n",
        "    *   Example: Adam is like a smart hiker who adjusts their pace (learning rate) based on the terrain (gradients) and their past movements (momentum).\n",
        "5.  RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation):\n",
        "    *   Explanation: An adaptive learning rate method that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the average of the squared gradients.\n",
        "    *   Example: RMSprop is like adjusting the sensitivity of a measuring device based on the fluctuations of the signal.\n",
